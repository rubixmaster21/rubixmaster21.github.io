Find all polynomials $P\in \mathbb{R}[x]$ such that
$$P(x\sqrt 2)=P(x+\sqrt{1-x^2})$$
for all $|x|\le 1$.
{% endcapture %}
{% include prob.html content=one type="Problem" %}

We claim the answer is $P(x)=x^2(x+1)^2(x-1)^2(x^2-2)$ up to scaling and shifting.

Under the condition, we are allowed to assume $P(0)=0$. Then, we substitute $x=\frac{\sin(t)}{2}$:
\\[P(\sin(t))=P(\sin(t+\pi/4)).\\]
So $P(x)$ is degree at least $8$, and in fact taking
\\[0=P(0)=P(\sin(\pi/4)\sqrt{2})=\dots\\]
gives us our answer.

Interestingly, the problem is given in the form
\\[P(x)=P(f(x));\\]
this means that for any integer $n$ we should have $P(x)=P(f^n(x))$.
But if $f$ was not periodic, this would force $P$ to be the constant polynomial.
So this guess helps to motivate the trig substitution.
