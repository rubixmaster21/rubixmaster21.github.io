<h3>
1st, Fri
</h3>
<p>
last day of VSA
</p>
<h3>
2nd, Sat
</h3>
<p>
Currently working on a way to make it easier to write into the main.html file thing<br>
so it will take a txt file, and append those contents to the html<br>
but with stuff like auto paragraph<br>
auto line break<br>
so it's easier that way<br>
and there also will be txt files of each small header
</p>
<p>
going well, 2:40 pm<br>
now I just have to do the part that edits the html file<br>
the rest will be up to what other features i want to add in the future
</p>
<p>
works fully now<br>
only thing really left is to figure out how to do the headache of list creating<br>
that would be useful
</p>
<p>
jul 6, i think it finally works now<br>
just testing to see if prev editing works as well
</p>


<h3>
3rd, Sat
</h3>
<strong>
OTIS app B.2 (and learning)
</strong>
<p>
there is something so nostalgic about seeing something you haven't touched in three years<br>
all the things you put places... all the specific little things you grew used to<br>
like revisiting a state of mind cached away somewhere...
</p>
<p>
this happened to me when I saw a diary i kept for three weeks in about april 2018 (5th grade)<br>
and now again today when I see the pc i used for years in elementary and middle
</p>
<p>
i think really what hits so hard is the difference in scope of mind<br>
i was such a different person back then, <br>
had such a narrower view of the world
</p>
<p>
not even to my own fault, because really i was just young?<br>
pretty sure that period to adolescence boosts your cognitive power, because how not?
</p>
<p>
ugh<br>
sometimes i see what was<br>
a false filter over the world<br>
ignorance really is bliss, i feel
</p>
<p>
and now to future me reading this in four years,<br>
sup<br>
please tell me you got somewhere<br>
please don't cringe at fake deep<br>
or real deep<br>
(among us)
</p>

<h3>
10th, Sun: The MAO Nats Experience, Day 1
</h3>
<strong>
2003 g2 + soln collections
</strong>
<p>
As of writing this, it is 11:31 PM, so I have been awake for almost 18 hours straight. Of the past 24 hours, I have been awake for almost 20 of them.
</p>
<p>
Wake up at 5:00 am. I am very tired and did not sleep well. After some packing and a small breakfast we head to the airport (amidst arguing about a missing lightning charging cable).
</p>
<p>
About 6:30 am. We arrive at the airport and Nick and I leave Mom. Everyone is bing chilling next to the luggage check-in counters. Going through security (of course), we end up sitting next to our gate. I teach Tom and Jesse how to play Skull in the 30 minutes we have before boarding.
</p>
<p>
Boarding is fairly easy and we get onto the plane. Throughout this entire experience I have silently been telling myself, "You have not done this in 3 years. Wow that is interesting." and also "Please remember this stuff so you can write it down later," just in wordless concepts instead.
</p>
<p>
As we taxi, I get very excited. The ground flies past us, rain streaking past the small window next to me.<br>
Takeoff! A twinge of fear shoots through my fingertips as we ascend. I continue feeling uneasy during our ascent, remembering the flight back home on New Year's 2019 from New York. (It felt as if we were continually rising, I was very scared for my life).<br>
The plane breaks through the clouds and an unearthly scene is laid out before me. Layers of clouds, casting shadows on the lower ones. Only minimal order is present, and there's hardly any motion. The picture strikes me as uncaring existence.
</p>
<p>
As the flight goes on I get a headache for whatever reason, and some nausea. This peaks when I am writing up my solution to 2003 G2 that I had just solved. I have to put my head down and push through.
</p>
<p>
We get to DCA. Lots of walking and bussing later, we arrive at the hotel we are staying at. Trips up, trips down, and we are spending our time in the lobby doing whatever. Later we go back up and film "Electrical", a hit indie film depicting the imposter being sussy.
</p>
<p>
Dinner. A mixer is apparently planned. Many people means crowded elevator. We are staying on the 20th floor. Piece it together. Ow my legs hurt.
</p>
<p>
The mixer is four unsatisfying (to me) puzzles. An actual puzzle (the one where you put together pieces), an easy cipher (considering the code is literally given to you on the top of the page), a tangram puzzle, and a spaghetti-and-marshmallow building contest. Whee. I want to just go to sleep but end up contributing to the building contest. I also make a tetrahedron because why not.
</p>
<p>
We finally take the elevator up because no way are my sore legs going up 20 flights of stairs. Details are given to all seven of us and finally we get here. I am typing this right now and oh jeez this took 15 minutes to write. Sure hope text wrapping works or I will have to manually put in breaks; this also makes the writing look less substantial.
</p>


<h3>
11th, Mon: The MAO Nats Experience, Day 2
</h3>
<p>
Tests today:<br>
<ul>
<li>Topic Test 1; Matrices & Vectors<br></li>
<li>Individuals<br></li>
<li>Chalk Talk<br></li>
<li>Hustle<br></li>
<li>Mystery Test<br></li>
<li>Mental Math<br></li>
</ul>
In order of fun:<br>
Mystery Test >>> Mental Math => Hustle >> Individuals >>> Matrices & Vectors >>>>>>>>> Chalk Talk
</p>
<p>
ranting about the. tests<br>
<ul>
<li><b>(Matrices and Vectors)</b> Oh dear. I do not like this test at all. Not at all. Aside from the amount of arithmetic you have to do concerning discriminants, a <i>large</i> portion of the test is memorization of definitions. In fact, I mixed up "determinant" with "discriminant" DURING the test. Add the sleepiness to the mix (<strong>12</strong> out of the past 48 hours slept means no brain head empty), and you get a pretty darn terrible testing experience. There are about four questions that I just cannot answer, because I don't remember Cramer's rule, or what an eigenvector is, or it is finding the sum of the entries of a (TEN times TEN) times (TEn times TEN) matrix. (When I see this I presume that this doesn't depend much on the specific entries because it was literally pi listed out.) Anyway, probably -15 what I could have gotten with proper sleep. ((Here I also have to mention that it took about four tries to see the error in 50-28=24. Great times.)<br></li>
<li><b>(Individuals)</b> No please no. I missed probably three questions to the most INANE mistakes, and about four more to clumsily crashing through the solution like a drunk. Again the sleep deprivation is probably the most important aspect of my failure here. More fun than Matrices & Vectors<br></li>
<li><b>(Chalk Talk)</b> Oop no preparation means bad presentation. seven minutes of phi->fibonacci numbers->generating functions<br></li>
<li><b>(Hustle)</b> Yay a fun test for once. We (Me, Jesse, Cordelia, Nick)  do okay on Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus, but note Stats and Probablilty.<br></li>
<li><b>(Mystery Test)</b> Probably the most fun test I have ever taken. *This is considering every test I have taken over my lifetime. The self-referentiallity was cranked up to 10; almost every question depended on the others. (The only questions answerable were 12,13,30.)<br></li>
<li><b>(Mental Math)</b> Another banger test. Mental math is always fun, even if the time format is 8 minutes for 40 questions. Only notable thing is that a question asked for 10! 36248800 != 3628800 <br></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
SCores<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>104</strong><br></li>
<li><strong>86</strong> FAT L<br></li>
<li>?<br></li>
<li>?<br></li>
<li><strong>150</strong>; Easy because of all the constraints<br></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Other stuff:<br>
We break convention rules multiple times by having people of differing genders in the same room. Two people worked on poster while everyone else was just bing chilling.<br>
Notable moment: receiving the hot dog sans image from eric<br>
"why does he keep sending this hot dog image"<br>
*blank stare*
</p>
<p>
At about 10:15 when everything is over i go to tom and jesse's room and watch/try Smash<br>
Backslash best move (for Shulk)

<h3>
12th, Tues: The MAO Nats Experience, Day 3
</h3>
<strong>
JMO 2011/2
</strong>
<p>
Some problem sources for me to pracrice:<br>
<ul>
<li>AIME<br></li>
<li>NIMO<br></li>
<li>SMT<br></li>
<li>HMMT<br></li>
<li>OMO<br></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Tests today:<br>
<ul>
<li>Topic Test 2; Complex Numbers<br></li>
<li>Ciphering<br></li>
<li>Interschool<br></li>
</ul>
Review:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Complex Numbers</b> Both a W and an L: 135 but bad disputes means score SHOULD be 145. Past that this is an easier test because it needs less brute force than Matrices and Vectors. And also 10 of the questions are bland "Manipulate with e^(itheta)" questions<br></li>
<li><b>Ciphering</b> Bad format for when you are tired AF. Committing in the first minute and then realizing your mistake in the second minute. Or writing 3+4=7 (values of k) instead of 2+3=5 (wanted, values of h)<br></li>
<li><b>Interschool</b> Fun, but humbling. The sections are Trivia, Math, Puzzles; Math consists of problems from past AMC 10 and past AIME. Several problems I have seen and I only remember one of them.<br></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Between Ciphering and Interschool is a talk. I pick "Adventures in Math" or whatever similar title it was. There is no lecturing, just seven incredibly mid puzzles.<br>
After Interschool everyone is supposed to attend a three hour Trivia session, but everyone in our group goes to room 2017 instead to "work" on our poster (read: have major life confusion and random laugh breakdown).
</p>
<p>
oop still bad at describing things that happen<br>
but I laugh too hard at 90 degree angle knee bending (from nick)<br>
and I improve a bit at Smash Bros; turns out the Tetris Effect can effect things that are also not Tetris (i see a character jumping then falling and attacking with special too often)
</p>

<h3>
13th, Wed: The MAO Nats Experience, Day 4
</h3>
<p>
Again I am fooled that it is "July 14" because it's past midnight whoops.<br>
Today we only had Monumental Math and there is not much to say to that. The word problems were wordy (who would have thought) and some of them were vague as well.
</p>
<p>
In the excursion, aside from the Museum of Natural History (which it happens that Nick and I have been to), I teach everyone how to griddy and get on the griddset.<br>
Unfortunately my journaling skills are waning so I don't have much else to say... 
</p>

<h3>
14th, Thurs: The MAO Nats Experience, Day 5
</h3>
<strong>
CQV-Perspectives progress
</strong>
<p>
Today we have school (alpha) bowl, and then a long awards ceremony. That goes terribly, we solved three problems out of 14. The awards ceremony was mostly boring, except when we win awards (such as: Monumental Math, Hustle, etc.) Let it not be forgotten that I got scammed out of Mental Math because of a "stray mark". Great.
</p>

Then we go back to our rooms to pack and mentally prepare for three hours of sleep. I try and pull an all-nighter (Cordelia does as well) but we both fail and have to be waken up by Nick. We bus ride our way to the airport and go to the terminal where we will wait for three hours. I get some of the grind done from a MAST unit (doing AIME with three hours of sleep CHALLENGE 3 am). Then after some stuff I write this masterpiece for Tom to read out:<br>
<div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,0.4);padding:10px;"><br>
<strong>Morbius x Mark Zuckerberg fanfictoin</strong><br>
<br>
Morbius morbed morbingly.<br>
Mr zuck himself entered the room with a smile.<br>
" burger kingd foot <br>
lettude," he said,. <br>
 He said, ""wow so deep" :flushed:<br>
but what when your mom <br>
and tucked him in bed.<br>
<br>
the zuck and the morb entered the meta-vers e (not to be confused with the M C U (Mrvel Ciemative Universe)<br>
Now with no physical constraints the zuck could do anything he wanted with the morb<br>
zuck pulled out a large rod<br>
suck it, he said<br>
ok, bmorb siad (he was hungry)<br>
the large rod got very wet<br>
it was in fact, a popsickle<br>
 zuck pulled out his own posicle to eat<br>
he then pulled down his pants<br>
"soryy, i have to take a ass"<br>
oops, said morbius<br>

"hi,' he said<br>
"hi," he said<br>
How are you "he said"<br>

He was standing sussily, while he hung from the seilng in his morb form<br>
She entered the room<br>
"diner is ready'<br>
Ok, he said<br>
alright, he said<br>
they both struggled to get up, entangled as they were<br>
the fluids they had shared flowed from their orfices<br>
they had cried to gether to the dream mask<br>
i wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time<br>
stare at his nutsack while i hold back my cum tonight<br>
and when he asks for a position isay<br>
etc.<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
the door opened<br>
he went through and he went through<br>
she left (she was just an incarnation for the purposes of plot developemenete)<br>
he and he left<br>
they hugged, still sharing theh high emotions from  earile<br>
